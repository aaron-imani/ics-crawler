MENTAL HEALTH NAVIGATOR
Traditionally, the regime of mental healthcare has followed an episodic psychotherapy model wherein patients seek care from a provider through a prescribed treatment plan developed over multiple provider visits. Recent advances in wearable and mobile technology have generated increased interest in digital mental healthcare that enables individuals to address episodic mental health symptoms. In the Mental Health Navigator project we are seeking to develop a comprehensive platform to measure, estimate, guide the individual’s mental health state within context of a therapist-in-the-loop, cybernetic goal-based system.
