Plenum




Plenum - Dynamical Grammar Simulator
 Plenum is a simulation software written in Mathematica for dynamical grammar
 models. Dynamical grammars are an elegant language for representing 
complex processes that include stochastic events and continuous 
dynamics.


Applications for dynamical grammars that were modeled in Plenum 
include: tissue development with stochastic cellular events and 
diffusion of signaling molecules, complex chemical reactions and 
simulations of spiral galaxy formation.
