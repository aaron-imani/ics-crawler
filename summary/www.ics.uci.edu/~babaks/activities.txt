DMS1936833 (PI: Shahbaba), 08/19-07/22NSFMODULUS: Data-Driven Mechanistic Modeling of Hierarchical TissuesThis project will develop new statistical and mathematical models that describe how cells and molecules within cells self organize to perform biological functions within an organism. More specifically, we will use our models to investigate hematopoiesis, which is a remarkable biological process responsible for creation and maintenance of blood cells, and involves complex interactions among biochemical and physical events across temporal and spatial scales that are still not well-understood.  Additionally, this project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with a true interdisciplinary experience with equal mentorship from data and biological scientists. R01MH115697 (Shahbaba), 01/18-12/22                                           NIH/NIMHRole: PI Scalable Bayesian Stochastic Process Models for Neural Data AnalysisThe overarching goal of this study is to understand the neural basis of complex behaviors and temporal organization of memories. To this end, we will develop a new powerful and scalable class of statistical models for studying multimodal neural data using Bayesian stochastic processes and computationally efficient algorithms. The potential clinical impact of this study is broad. Our research will address fundamental and unresolved questions about hippocampal function, and these novel approaches may subsequently lead to unprecedented insight into the neural mechanisms underlying memory impairments.See our GitHub page for a brief report of our findings and results.
