Summary


 Checks  


Past versions





Last updated: 2021-06-02


Checks:  2  0


Knit directory: uci_covid_modeling2/  


This reproducible R Markdown analysis was created with workflowr (version 1.6.2.9000). The Checks tab describes the reproducibility checks that were applied when the results were created. The Past versions tab lists the development history.








  R Markdown file: up-to-date 




Great! Since the R Markdown file has been committed to the Git repository, you know the exact version of the code that produced these results.






  Repository version: 2a1089e 





Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.


The results in this page were generated with repository version 2a1089e. See the Past versions tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.


Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use wflow_publish or wflow_git_commit). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
