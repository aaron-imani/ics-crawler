Research Opportunities
We are always seeking new undergraduate and graduate students to get involved in our research. Occasionally we have opportunities for paid undergraduate research positions. Please contact Stacy or Anne Marie if you are interested in joining our group. An excellent first step for undergraduates is to take a course in human-computer interaction. Prospective PhD students should apply through UCI's Informatics PhD Program.
