    				Events: Unaware of events    			


Google released Hot Trends.Â  In an interview, the developer of the software, Mr Amit Patel, said something interesting related to eventweb that I found interesting:
“There are events going on all the time that most of us are not aware of happening,” said Patel.
This insight that events are happening all the time and people are interested in finding such common — or popular or hot — events is important not only in search engines but in many other fields.Â  But how does one find such events is an interesting issue.Â  Hot Trends capitalizes on the availability of each search as an atomic event.Â  If one can store such atomic events in other applications, then it would be possible to search for hot trends in those applications also.
