Automated Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence

My research is in the field of Automated Reasoning in Artificial Intelligence and focused on Graphical Models. Graph based models (e.g., Bayesian and constraint networks, influence diagrams and Markov decision processes) are a central paradigm for knowledge representation and reasoning in both Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science in general. These models are used to accomplish many science and engineering tasks, such as scheduling, planning and learning, diagnosis and prediction, design, hardware and software verification and bioinformatics. They are also instrumental for learning schemes. These reasoning problems can be stated as the formal tasks of constraint satisfaction and satisfiability, combinatorial optimization and probabilistic inference.

Since most reasoning tasks are computationally intractable, my primary approach is to devise anytime approximations methods through the understanding and exploitation of tractable reasoning tasks. As their name implies, anytime methods provide a solution anytime during the processing, hopefully with error bounds, that are tightened if more time is available, eventually resulting in exact answers. 

My previous works on greedy problems, the mechanical generation of heuristics, the identification of tractable constraint models via topological decompositions, and the establishment of boundaries of local computations have been driven by this principal concern. With my students, I analyze algorithms both analytically and empirically using real life applications such as scheduling, planning, and diagnosis.

In probabilistic graphical models we introduced the two unifying algorithmic frameworks of bucket-elimination and AND/OR search which capture the most common styles of human reasoning (e.g., Inference, and conditioning). Bucket elimination unifies dynamic programming for combinatorial optimization with algorithms for theorem proving, logic programs, temporal reasoning, probabilistic reasoning and planning under uncertainty. AND/OR search allows exploiting problem decomposition during search and is the basis to many recent algorithmic advances in graphical models. Our framework allows leveraging the strength variational methods yielding tractable-based heuristics to guide AND/OR search and Monte-Carlo schemes and facilitate their integrations.

In sum, my research interests are in the areas of Automated Reasoning, Knowledge-Representation, Planning and Learning.
