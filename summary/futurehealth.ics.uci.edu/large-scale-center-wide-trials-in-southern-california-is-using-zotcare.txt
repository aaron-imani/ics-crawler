A large scale center-wide trial in Southern California is using ZotCare
August 22, 2022
The IFH tool, ZotCare, is being used in a large scale center-wide trial in Southern California.
The UCI has recently received a $17.9 million grant from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. The project is addressing health inequities that lead to cardiovascular diseases in low-income and minority groups within the greater Los Angeles and Orange County region. Prof. Bernadette Boden-Albala, the founding dean of the planned School of Population & Public Health and director of UCI’s Program in Public Health, serves as the PI of the grant. See more details here.
This project is using ZotCare — IFH’s remote monitoring platform — to remotely monitor more than one-thousand hypertensive patients in Southern California. It should be noted that despite having access to existing EHR-based systems, the team decided to use ZotCare because of its flexibility and advanced features.
