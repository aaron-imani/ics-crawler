Frequently Asked Questions




I am an international student. Can I apply?
Unfortunately no. This is a federally funded program and thus only US citizens and permanent residents are elligible to apply.

I will graduate and complete my undergraduate degree before the start of the ISI-BUDS program. Can I apply?
The program is not open to graduating seniors and requires enrollment as an undergraduate student.

I have other commitments during ISI-BUDS and will miss a few days (or a day). Can I still apply and enroll in the program?
Participants are expected to attend the full program, full time (~ 40 per week).
