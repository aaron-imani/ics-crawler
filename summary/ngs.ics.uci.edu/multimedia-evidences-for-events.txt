    				Multimedia Evidences for Events    			


Amarnath Gupta gave a keynote talk at Computer Vision and Data Bases (CVDB) workshop help with SIGMOD conference in Beijing, China,Â  I missed the talk, but he was kind enough to send me his presentation.Â  Very interesting presentation â€“ you can see it here â€“ it is a large file.
Amarnath views multimedia as evidence for real world events and argues that this may open up interesting way to look at media.Â  This is definitely an intriguing perspective.Â  I used to think media as experiential data for event â€“ his perspective takes it further in the direction of analysis oriented approaches.Â
