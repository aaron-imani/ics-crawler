After spending six years at the Department of Computer Science, 
			University of California Irvine I moved to 
			the University of Utah. My current web page 
			is here. 
			My team designs, and builds novel operating systems. Our work spans a broad variety of topics 
                        from novel low-latency datacenters to secure and verified kernels. 

		

I run Mars Research Group.
