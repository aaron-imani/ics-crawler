Initiatives
Public safety, public safety technologies, and research within public safety are a continually growing domain.  CERT will serve as a vehicle to pursue funding within public safety from agencies such as NSF (e.g., an ERC), DARPA, and others.

We are working in the following research areas: situational awareness, acoustic location sensing, robust networking, human bio-sensing, incident visualization, and disaster/disaster response simulation.
