Our first 2019-20 Meeting
What's coming in Fall '19


Our First Meeting
Thank you to everyone who was able to make it to our first Cyber meeting in DBH 1423. We had a great turnout, and got to introduce several students into what we do as a club, and into the broader world of security as a whole.
General Meeting Dates
For Fall quarter we will be having Cyber meetings every other week, so weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. These meetings will be held at 6:30pm in DBH 1423* (subject to change).
CCDC Meetings
As usual our ccdc team will be meeting Friday of every week at 4:30pm. Join the #ccdc channel on the slack for more info about those.
CTF
Cyber plans on helping to create a group of members that specifically focus on CTFs, and who will be part of the general Cyber CTF team. This CTF team will work together to learn about CTFs, compete in CTF competitions, and also help to create the Cyber @ UCI CTF, that Cyber @ UCI will be hosting.
LANs
This quarter Cyber and CCDC will also be hosting LANs in addition to the general Cyber meetings, CCDC meetings, and CTF team. We will be working to create LAN events and LAN parties for our members to enjoy, as well as invite members to help setting up those LAN environments, to give them experience working with real network setup.
- David Parra | CCDC Team Lead
