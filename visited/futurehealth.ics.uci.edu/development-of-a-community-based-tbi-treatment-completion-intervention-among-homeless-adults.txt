Development of a Community-based TBI Treatment Completion Intervention Among Homeless Adults
Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of poverty as it disproportionately affects impoverished communities. In the US, TB rates are unacceptably high among homeless persons who have a 10-fold increase in TB incidence as compared to the general population. In California, the rate of TB is more than twice the national case rate and recent TB outbreaks have been alarming. Given the complex health disparity factors that affect TBI treatment adherence among homeless persons, in this project, we will develop and pilot test an innovative, community-based directly observed intervention. Our innovative health promotion intervention program focuses on: 1) completion of TBI treatment, 2) reducing substance use; 3) improving mental health; and 4) improving critical social determinants of TB risk (unstable housing and poor health care access) among homeless adults in the highest TB prevalence area in Los Angeles.
