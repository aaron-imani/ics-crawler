Committees









ICS Student Council has five committees to provide different ways for students to contribute to the community. 





Public Relations Committee


            The Public Relations committee is in charge of keeping the ICS community informed on what's going on with ICS Student Council.
            We keep our social medias (Instagram and Facebook) up to date with the latest news on events, workshops, and socials.
            Since ICS Student Council works as an umbrella organizations for all the other wonderful ICS organizations/clubs on campus, we strive to help out the best we can in promoting all ICS events.
            So if you are apart of an ICS organization and would like help in publicizing your events, please reach out to us. Anyone can feel free to contact us on our social media because we love to chat with you and answer any questions you may have about our organization or to just let you know what's going on!
            Don't forget to like our Facebook page at https://facebook.com/ICSStudentCouncil/" and follow us on Instagram at @icssc.uci!

Corporate Outreach Committee


            The Corporate Outreach Committee for ICSSC is responsible for establishing and maintaining professional and financial relationships with corporate supporters and alumni in the computer science industry.
            These relationships are crucial for receiving financial sponsorship for ICS events, for hosting informational workshops held for UCI students, and for student recruiting purposes.
            Our job is to network with alumni and company representatives to remind them that the School of ICS has national prestige, and to help them find something at UCI that appeals to their outreach and funding interests.
