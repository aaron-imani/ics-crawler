Evoking Transformative Play Day with Middle Schoolers  – July 29th, 2015 






 



















Wednesday July 29th, 2015 in collaboration with EVOKE, UCI’s Video Game Development Club, FABWorks and the STAR lab, the Transformative Play Lab and the middle-school teachers, students and staff at CDS co-developed an assortment of diverse “hands on” interactions for small groups of students (grade 5-7). Afterward we reflected on the ideas evoked through the experience and continue to develop student-driven projects which re-imagine STEM narratives through physical making, playful fabrication, and creative collaboration.Station 1.
