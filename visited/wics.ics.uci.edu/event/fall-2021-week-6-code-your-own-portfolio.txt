Hey, Elsa! Do you want to build a portfolio? C’mon, join us and have some fun. It is going to be a beginner friendly workshop with step-by-step instructions on the basics of HTML and CSS to build your very own portfolio. You’ll be creating the website’s user interface and personalizing your own versions of the pages. Don’t worry, it is going to be easy to follow as there will be demos and members to guide you through the process. All majors welcome! Remember to RSVP for the workshop!
