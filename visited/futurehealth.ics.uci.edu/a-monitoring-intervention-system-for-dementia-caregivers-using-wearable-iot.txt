A Monitoring-Intervention System for Dementia Caregivers Using Wearable IoT
Our program aims to build caregiving and stress-management skills in family caregivers of persons with dementia or mild cognitive impairment. The study involves remote monitoring using wearable sensors, home visits, and follow-ups. This research is led by Dr. Jung-Ah Lee (https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/caregiverstudy/).
