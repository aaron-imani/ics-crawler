    				Text Mining NYT    			


A team from University of California, Irvine (from Bren School of Information and COmputer Science; my school) has demonstrated a powerful text mining approach based on topic modeling.  This approach is based on a ‘bag of word’ model to represent a topic.  As reported in the blog by Roland Piquepaille (Thanks to Rajesh Jain for pointing this to me), this has very strong potential for application in many areas.
