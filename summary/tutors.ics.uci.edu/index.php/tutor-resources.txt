Pedagogical Materials
Pedagogical materials are exercises, guides, and other forms of miscellaneous media created by our tutors that serve the purpose of acting as an educational supplement to course materials. Experienced tutors have the opportunity to create new materials whereas first time tutors also play an essential part in the process by acting as reviewers, ensuring the material's quality. 
Materials are separated by language. Topics common between languages may exist (e.g: recursion).
PythonÂ 
Java
C/C++
Assembly
