About Lecturer:The annual Symposium on “AI and Biomedicine” organized by the UCI Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics will be held on Friday September 24th, 2021. The current plan is to hold the event in the Calit2 Auditorium, providing you with one of the first opportunities to reconnect live with your colleagues after the long COVID-pandemic hiatus.
