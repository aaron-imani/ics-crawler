The long-term impact of light intervention on sleep physiology and cognition in mild cognitive impairment
This application proposes to investigate the impact of a long-term lighting treatment on sleep physiology and sleep-dependent cognitive processes in MCI and mild AD patients. We hypothesize that a long-term (6-month) lighting intervention technology (LIT) designed to promote circadian entrainment will improve sleep and, thus cognition. We also hypothesize that LIT will improve depression and quality of life (QoL).
