                <td width="50%" valign="top"><h4>Quick Biography</h4>
                  <p>Prof. Michael Franz was an early pioneer in the areas
                    of mobile code and dynamic compilation. He created an early just-in-time compilation system, contributed to the theory and practice of continuous compilation and optimization, and co-invented the trace compilation technology that eventually became the JavaScript engine in Mozilla's Firefox browser.</p>
                  <p>His current
                    research emphasis lies in the area of <strong>Software Systems</strong>, particularly focusing on compiler, virtual machine, and related system-level techniques for making software either <strong>safer</strong>, or <strong>faster</strong>, or <strong>both</strong>. Some of this research also falls under the labels <strong>Computer Security</strong>, <strong>Trustworthy Computing</strong>, and <strong>Software Engineering</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Franz has graduated 35 Ph.D. students as their primary advisor and has published more than 140 peer-reviewed research papers. He is the
                      Principal Investigator on many competitive grants from
                  the federal government, totaling  over $24M (of which more than $15M as sole PI), and has received more than a million dollars in unrestricted gifts from industry in appreciation of the research innovations he has contributed.</p>
                  <p>Franz received a Dr.
                    sc. techn. degree in Computer Science (advisor: <a href="http://www.inf.ethz.ch/%7Ewirth">Niklaus
                      Wirth</a>) and a Dipl. Informatik-Ing. ETH degree, both
                    from the <a href="http://www.ethz.ch/index_EN">Swiss Federal Institute
                      of Technology, ETH Zurich</a>. He is a Fellow of the Americal Association for the Advancement of Science (<a href="https://www.aaas.org/">AAAS</a>), a Distinguished Scientist and a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (<a href="http://www.acm.org/">ACM</a>), a Fellow of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (<a href="http://www.ieee.org">IEEE</a>), and an Inaugural Fellow of the International Federation for Information Processing  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_for_Information_Processing">IFIP</a>).</p>

                      <p>I want to recognize all the fantastic students who have worked with me at UCI over the years &mdash; overall, I have graduated 34 Ph.Ds as their primary advisor. While it is usually the professor who gets all the glory, my collaborators on most of this groundbreaking research were UCI graduate students and PostDocs. I am very grateful for their contribution and it has been both a joy and a privilege to serve as their advisor</p>
                      <p>Additionally, I need to acknowledge the wisdom of the University of California, who agreed to donate the intellectual property rights to some of our inventions to the open source community. My Ph.D. student Andreas Gal and I actually received a U.S. Patent on the compiler technology that underlies the original JavaScript just-in-time compiler in Firefox, and this patent is of course owned by UC. By allowing this technology to be used for free without royalties, UC played a crucial part in making all of this happen.                      </p>

                      <p>I have been one of the pioneers of dynamic compilation research. My first paper  on JIT compilation was published in 1991 and my dissertation, entitled &quot;Code Generation On-The-Fly: A Key To Portable Software,&quot; appeared two full years before the announcement of Java. Over the past twenty years, my students and I have worked on different aspects of dynamic compilation, most recently focusing on the development of <em>Trace Compilation </em>on which <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/press/bios/andreas-gal/">Andreas Gal</a> and I <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US8769511">recently received a U.S. patent</a>.</p>
                      <p>This work has had substantial impact. The trace compilation technology behind the &quot;<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/JavaScript:TraceMonkey">TraceMonkey</a>&quot; JavaScript compiler that is built into Mozilla's Firefox browser (since June 2009 / Firefox 3.5) originated in our lab. It is used daily by several hundred million people. More recently, the &quot;Compartmental Memory Management&quot; technique invented by my student Gregor Wagner has also made it into the mainline Firefox distribution (since March 2011 / Firefox 4.0).</p></td>
