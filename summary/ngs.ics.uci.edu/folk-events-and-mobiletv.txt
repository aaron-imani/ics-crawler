    				Folk Events and MobileTV    			


According to all reports, the technology for video and TV on mobile phones is rapidly gaining in popularity.  The competition in this area is increasing very rapidly.  A business week article describes this situation very well.
It appears to me that video on mobile phones will really play a more important role in telepresence like applications.  Soon we are likely to see people starting to broadcast different private and local events using webcames.   When this happens, interested people will want to attend the remote event live.  And this will result in more people created events — or folk events — going live leading to more people using their mobile devices to be telepresent.   I think that this virtuous cycle is likely to start soon — maybe 2007 will be the year for this to really becoming popular.
