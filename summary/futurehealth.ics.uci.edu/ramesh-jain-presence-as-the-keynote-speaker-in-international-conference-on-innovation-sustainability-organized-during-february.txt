INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION ft SUSTAINABILITY

Building Food Atlas for Great Food Experience
Food is the most important source of joy and health. Despite all advances in technology and social consciousness, there are two important challenging problems related to food that must be solved. Food for health and food for enjoyment are considered distinct attributes. What I like to eat is often not what helps my body! Much has been written about how to make food tastier and how to eat healthily. However, every person is different in her taste and enjoyment of food and her body is different in responding to different ingredients in food items. Ideally, food should be customized for each person. We believe that the technology is now ready to address this important challenge. In this presentation we will discuss how to build a digital food atlas and using that for selecting food for personal enjoyment and health. It is now within the realm of science and technology to help us select food that will help us enjoy it and keep us healthy.
Please find attached some snaps of your session, recording video link of the session, conference souvenir and a thank you note from our Hon’ble Vice Chancellor, JKLU.
