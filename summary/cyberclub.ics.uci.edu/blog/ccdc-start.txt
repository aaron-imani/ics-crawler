CCDC is Back!
2019-20 Season Kick Off Meeting


In case you didn’t hear, last year our CCDC Team made it all the way to third place in the Western Region against other schools from California, Nevada, and Arizona. We also won first place for overall defense and third place for service uptime (read more).
After such an amazing season, we need one more thing: you. We’re revamping and using this quarter to start from the basics of Cybersecurity over a series of weekly meetings. We would love to see you at our kickoff meeting at:


Friday April 12th at 3pm in ICS 432


Best,
The CCDC Team
