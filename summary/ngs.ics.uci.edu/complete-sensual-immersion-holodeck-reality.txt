    				Complete sensual immersion — Holodeck reality    			


I had not heard of creating an immersive environment that will include all five human senses.  Audio, visual, and tactile are common, and smell has been tried.  But had not heard of serious claims to use of taste in an immersive system.  Two Welsh scientists are experimenting with total sensual immersion as reported recently.  SOunds really intriguing.
