    				Events becoming popular    			


In the last few weeks, it is truly amazing how many times people have told me about the importance of the concept of events.
I am very pleased by growing recognition of the concept of events.  Objects and events are two concepts that together will help in understanding and managing evolving applications of computing and will help us better understand many things that we have been trying.  And this is true across a really diverse set of applications.
I will talk more about it soon, but at this moment I am just pleased and a bit surprised how suddenly people from research community to VCs to practising engineers have told me the importance of this concept.
That only increases my determination to pursue this area more strongly.
