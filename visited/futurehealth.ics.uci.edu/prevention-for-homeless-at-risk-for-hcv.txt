Prevention for Homeless At-Risk for HCV
Compared to the general population, homeless persons have a 26-fold increase in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) prevalence, a diagnosis strongly associated with injection drug use (IDU). Focused screening, early detection, and treatment for homeless adults are critical for effective treatment. In this project, we develop a theoretically-based innovative model of care among HCV-infected homeless persons by utilizing a community-based delivery approach.
