Understanding life events and transitions supported by fertility apps
Women’s health needs change over the course of life, transitioning between health stages and goals such as menarche, pregnancy or avoidance, and menopause. We sought to understand the extent to which fertility and health tracking apps support these life stages and the transitions between them. We find that oftentimes these apps support the “typical” cases reasonably well (healthy people in their 20’s and 30’s), but miss the transition needs of younger and older people or people with other challenges (e.g., infertility). We find a need to design tools which are more integrative, bringing together data from varied sources to help support more holistic tracking.
