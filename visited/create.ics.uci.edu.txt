UCI’s Steckler Center for Responsible, Ethical, and Accessible Technology (CREATE) 
UCI’s Steckler Center for Responsible, Ethical, and Accessible Technology (CREATE) was established in 2020 through a generous gift from Vincent (BS ’80) and Amanda Steckler. We promote research and education into the challenges of creating technological futures that produce positive change in the world, focused on principles of equity, accountability, and care. Based in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, we are home to a community of scholars whose research draws on a range of disciplines including information science, computer science, science and technology studies, law, anthropology, media studies, sociology, philosophy, political science, and economics.
Our research asks, what barriers exist to equitable participation in technological futures, and how can they be dismantled? What principles should guide the design of technologies and platforms? How should technological processes and infrastructures be reconfigured to place justice and care at the center, and to promote human rights and social values?  Our goals are to amplify and expand UCI’s research in these areas and provide a forum for engagement amongst researchers, practitioners, policy-makers, and civic society participants.
Forthcoming activities include Ph.D. fellowship opportunities, a program of public discussions, on-campus competition for research seed funds, and targeted community outreach. We welcome the participation of researchers and other stakeholders with contributions to make in these areas of investigation.
