Meet the Dean


Marios C. Papaefthymiou, Ph.D.
Ted and Janice Smith Family Foundation DeanProfessor of Computer Science
Marios Papaefthymiou is professor of computer science and the Ted and Janice Smith Family Foundation dean of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) at University of California, Irvine. He joined UC Irvine in 2017 as the third dean for ICS. Before coming to UC Irvine, Papaefthymiou was professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, where he served as chair of computer science and engineering, overseeing one of the fastest-growing and most innovative academic programs in computing across the nation. Prior to Michigan, he was on the faculty at Yale.  Papaefthymiou’s research interests are in architectures and design methodologies for energy-efficient high-performance computers. With more than 100 publications on this topic, Papaefthymiou holds 21 US and international patents on energy-efficient computing and is co-founder and chief scientist of Cyclos Semiconductor, a Michigan spin-off commercializing energy-efficiency solutions for high-end computers. His accolades include a Young Investigator Award from ARO, a CAREER award from NSF, a number of Faculty Partnership Awards from IBM, and multiple best paper awards. Papaefthymiou grew up in Athens, Greece, and studied at the National Technical University of Athens before transferring to Caltech, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. He then went on to earn master’s and doctorate degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from MIT.
