    				Uploading photos    			


A friend suggestedÂ that IÂ see two sites for uploading photos that are really very easy to use and I did find that they are very easy to use, much easier than anything that I had seen.Â  These are
bitemyphoto and allyoucanupload.Â  In fact allyoucanupload does not even require registration.
I find these sites interesting because they represent a step in a right direction.Â  I do hope that this technology will be combined with image search to make organizing and searching phots really easy.Â  And that will happen soon so I can manage all my photos.
