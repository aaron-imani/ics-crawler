    				Year of Events    			


I was delighted to read a very timely piece by Arun Katiyar in Deccan Herald —
http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec312006/finearts19104920061230.asp
This piece talks why year 2007 is likely to be the year of Events.Â  I agree with thisÂ articleÂ strongly and thought of sharing this on the eve of the New Year.Â 
Â My very best to you for a rewarding and satisfying events for you in 2007.Â
