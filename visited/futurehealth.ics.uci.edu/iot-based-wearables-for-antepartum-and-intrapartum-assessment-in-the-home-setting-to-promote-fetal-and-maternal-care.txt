IoT-based Wearables for Antepartum and Intrapartum Assessment in the Home Setting to Promote Fetal and Maternal Care
This project develops novel tools and leverage cutting-edge technologies in bioelectronics and data science to improve fetal and maternal care for early prenatal, antepartum and intrapartum periods. Specifically, it develops novel abdominal patches with secure telecommunication for fetal ECG monitoring, novel wearables and schemes to continuously monitor maternal blood pressure (mBP), and an app and secured cloud to collect and analyze data.
