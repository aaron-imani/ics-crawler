A Seminar on:
mHealth for behavioral intervention in older and vulnerable populations

Abstract:Digital solutions are still underutilized in the deployment of interventions to promote health behaviors in older and vulnerable populations. Although several factors may bridge this implementation gap, an important step toward promoting digital intervention development and accelerating the rate of adoption within the scientific and clinical community is to provide more evidence with respect to the efficacy of digital interventions for eliciting behavioral change and to explicitly model behavioral change features that might account for changes in the targeted behavior. In this talk, I will describe several mechanistic projects in which we deployed wearable, mobile and web-based interventions to promote health in people with osteoarthritis, frailty, and dementia.


Speaker’s bio:
Oleg Zaslavsky is Associate Professor in the Biobehavioral Nursing and Health Informatics department at the University of Washington School of Nursing. His research focuses on digital behavioral intervention for the vulnerable and older population including older adults with frailty, multimorbidity, and dementia. He is a recipient of several federal awards and published more than 80 peer-review publications. Since 2017 Dr. Zaslavsky has been a core member of the interdisciplinary Behavioral Research in Technology and Engineering Center (BRiTE) at the University of Washington School of Medicine, which is dedicated to improving behavioral health through technology.
