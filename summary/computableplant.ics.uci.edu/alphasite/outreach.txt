                   The Computable Plant project has been active in developing, evaluating, and introducing a new set of techniques for high school and pre-service 		                   science teachers as well as undergraduate students.
                   
                   Outreach activities focus on the training of high school teachers in the annual 
                   "Grounding in Botany" 
                   program of the Huntingon Botanical Gardens,
                   which continues to host more than 500,000 visitors per year.
                   
                   This program holds remarkable promise for linking cutting-edge knowledge and 
                   techniques with K-12 teachers' and students' understanding of plant development and integrative biology.
