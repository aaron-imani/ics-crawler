Dependency Diagrams







	Dependency Diagrams 
      


	Dependency diagrams are an extension of standard graphical
	model notation.
	Dependency diagrams add to factor graphs 
	the power to represent indexing, gating, and hard constraints. 
	This new formalism makes the modeling of 
	systems with  unknown or variable structures explicit and
	straightforward. 
	The dependency diagram framework also 
	enables the automatic translation of diagrams that represent models 
	into diagrams that represent Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
	and inference  
	algorithms, and the subsequent autogeneration of runnable
	code.
	


	Source code implementing the dependency diagram framework
	within Mathematica,
	along
	with files specifying a number of simple models, is available
	here.
