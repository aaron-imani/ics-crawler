      <p>Welcome!  Please note a few things as we get started this quarter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This course is being offered in a <i>virtual-remote</i> format, which is to say that your physical presence on campus will not be required at any point during the quarter.  We are, however, offering in-person labs &mdash; each of you is enrolled in a lab section &mdash; but there will be no requirement that you attend; they're a place to get help when you need it.
          <ul>
            <li><i>Note: For at least the first two weeks of the quarter, labs will be meeting virtually.  We will let you know when in-person labs will begin meeting.</i></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You may find that each course you're enrolled in this quarter runs quite differently from the others, so I encourage you to read through this course web site for details on how this course will be run.  Notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>, and the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a>, as well as sets of <a href="NotesAndExamples">Notes and Examples</a> and <a href="Exercises">Reinforcement Exercises</a> that will be posted throughout the quarter.</li>
        <li>Additional to this web site, you will find that there is a Canvas course space, as well as a discussion forum on Ed Discussion.  More details about how we'll be using each of these spaces is available in the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.</li>
        <li>Please note that a warm-up project, <a href="ProjectGuide/Project0">Project #0</a>, is due on Friday, January 7 at 11:59pm, so you're going to want to be sure to get off to an early start on that.</li>
      </ul>
