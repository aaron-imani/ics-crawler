ICS Storage Service Upgrade (01/05/2022)


A couple of notes about the ICS Home Directory.


 The school provides an ICS Home Directory. for every member of the ICS community.

 That ICS home directory is available to any computer connected to the Campus Network(even via VPN).

 The ICS home directory is, typically, automatically available on any ICS managed Windows and Linux system.

 Backed up twice daily



Beginning Fall 2021, all home directories are being stored on a new Purestorage Flashblade named tardigrade.ics.uci.edu, occasionally abbreviated as tg.ics.uci.edu.


Tardigrade Highlights:


 Backed by all flash storage so home directory access is fast 

 Redundant 40Gb/s uplink to the ICS Data Center Backbone

 Inline compression (data reduction factor of ~1.6)

 28 days of self service snapshots + long term disaster recovery backups
