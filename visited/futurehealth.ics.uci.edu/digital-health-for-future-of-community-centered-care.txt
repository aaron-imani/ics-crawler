Digital Health for Future of Community-Centered Care
The adhoc nature of the healthcare system in the USA necessitates an organized and affordable platform to increase the reach and services to the majority of the population. Currently, caregivers provide critical medical assistance in a community setting, particularly for elderly, disabled and vulnerable populations. Several states including California employ a community healthcare worker (CHW) initiative as an alternative to registered health care professionals to extend the reach of home-delivered services. While there is a critical need to scale and personalize these services, it faces significant challenges in the face of the increasing number of elderly, disabled and vulnerable communities requiring medical assistance, coupled with low wages for caregivers and rapidly increasing demands for skilled labor. The existing community-centered care (CCC) model is led by registered nurses (RNs) who train and supervise the CHWs, who in turn provide the necessary care for the community. This CCC model suffers from an inability to scale in a cost-effective manner while providing personalized and quality care for the community. The project proposes the digital health enabled community-centered care (D-CCC) model to transform the manual, restricted, and unstructured state of the current community healthcare landscape into a scalable, digital, and automated space.
