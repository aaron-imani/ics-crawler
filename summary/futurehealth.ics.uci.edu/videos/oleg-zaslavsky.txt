mHealth for behavioral intervention in older and vulnerable population


Abstract
Digital solutions are still underutilized in the deployment of interventions to promote health behaviors in older and vulnerable populations. Although several factors may bridge this implementation gap, an important step toward promoting digital intervention development and accelerating the rate of adoption within the scientific and clinical community is to provide more evidence with respect to the efficacy of digital interventions for eliciting behavioral change and to explicitly model behavioral change features that might account for changes in the targeted behavior. In this talk, I will describe several mechanistic projects in which we deployed wearable, mobile and web-based interventions to promote health in people with osteoarthritis, frailty, and dementia.
