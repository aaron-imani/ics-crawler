This year, we\u2019ve pulled together a list of resources, including on-campus groups here at UCI. We also list some nationwide organizations and books that focus on diversity and race in technology, as well as spotlight some Black leaders in computer science and engineering, both on and off campus.        \u201cWhen we think about Black History Month, we usually begin by acknowledging those who have come before us and who are often overlooked in our society,\u201d says Gregory Diggs-Yang, assistant director of the Stacey Nicholas Office of Access and Inclusion (OAI). \u201cWe should always honor those trailblazers, but we should also recognize those great contributors who are currently widening the trail and those who are just beginning down it.\u201d    Created in 2014, OAI is a joint office between ICS and the Henry Samueli School of Engineering, focused on recruiting, retaining and graduating talented students from historically excluded populations. \u201cThe following is not meant to be an exhaustive list,\u201d stresses Diggs-Yang, \u201cbut rather a starting point for reflection during Black History Month and a way to recognize current Black visionaries and new pioneers. I am excited to be acknowledging the current unsung heroes of Black history as it is being made.\u201d    Creating a Supportive Campus CultureWe start with a list of organizations at UCI that are focused on supporting the Black community:    The Black Faculty &amp; Staff Association (BFSA) provides a sense of purpose for African American faculty and staff by creating a presence on campus that is visible, supportive, nurturing and productive in serving the needs of the African American community (sign up for the BFSA list serve).The Black Graduate Student Network (BGSN) provides an encouraging, inclusive, social networking community for African American graduate and professional students at UCI. The organization\u2019s goals are to strengthen camaraderie among African American students, celebrate the culture they proudly represent, and voice their life and educational experiences to younger underrepresented students so that they may be inspired and supported to pursue graduate education.The Center for Black Cultures, Resources &amp; Research (CBCRR) provides a just, safe, vibrant, inclusive, culturally supportive and socio-ecologically sustainable space \u2014 a home away from home \u2014 where Black students can thrive and reach for their highest potential.The East African Student Association (EASA) is a cultural organization dedicated to building a community among the East African student population and sharing meaningful experiences and conversations.The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) is a student organization that helps improve the recruitment and retention of Black engineering students.The Nigerian Student Association (NSA) is a cultural organization that aims to bring together students and staff from the African diaspora who are interested in learning more about the roots and beauty of Nigeria.     https:\/\/youtu.be\/oRcEvd1sc7s This short video introduces each of the campus organizations listed above.    These are in addition to UCI\u2019s Black Thriving Initiative, developed specifically to recognize and respond to \u201canti-Blackness as an existential threat to our mission as public research university.\u201d The initiative is working to create a university culture where Black people thrive.

BookerRace After Technology by Ruha BenjaminSasha Savvy Loves to Code by Sasha Ariel Alston (children\u2019s book)Women of Color in Tech: A Blueprint for Inspiring and Mentoring the Next Generation of Technology Innovators by Susanne Tedrick    Following Influential LeadersMany of the organizations listed earlier were founded by pioneering tech leaders, some of whom we highlight here, along with other Black leaders in STEM. This is just a small sampling of the many Black innovators we hope you\u2019re following on social media:    Michael Berhane is co-founder and CEO of POCIT.Loretta Cheeks is CEO of StrongTIES.Tony Effik is a managing director at Google and a passionate advocate of diversity and inclusion.Aicha Evans is the first African American female CEO of an autonomous vehicle technology company (Zoox).Yeshimabeit Milner is executive director of Data for Black Lives.Hadiyah Mujhid is founder and CEO of HBCUvc.Sofia Ongele is a student, coder, and activist who developed ReDawn, an award-winning app that helps survivors of sexual and domestic abuse and their loved ones.Meme Styles is founder and president of Measure.Bria Sullivan is a software engineer at Google and CEO and founder of Tech Stack\u2019d.Tristan Walker is co-founder of Code2040.Saron Yitbarek is creator of CodeNewbie.    Highlighting UCI InnovatorsOf course, we also want to highlight Black innovators in STEM here at UCI in engineering and in the information and computer sciences.        In the Samueli School of Engineering, Assistant Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Tayloria Adams studies the physical properties of stem cell and cancer cell populations using innovative microfluidic devices. Her projects use electric currents and cell motion to develop membrane capacitance and other measurable cellular properties as reliable label-free biological markers. She holds a patent for her discoveries and was a National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral Fellow and UCI Chancellor\u2019s ADVANCE Postdoctoral Fellow. Adams recently earned a prestigious NSF CAREER award and an award from the University of California Cancer Research Coordinating Committee. Also, she is working with a multidisciplinary team to develop a curriculum focused on the meaningful engagement of minoritized students in the classroom. This NSF-funded grant, led by Pheather R. Harris, director of UCI\u2019s California Alliance for Minority Participation, is cutting-edge and explores the environmental factors causing minoritized students to leave STEM. Adams is also highly engaged in activities to increase the number of Black high school, undergraduate and graduate students pursuing STEM fields.    \u201cBlack History Month is very important to me,\u201d says Adams. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance for reflection on the strength of my ancestors, which I channel into my research, teaching, and service. I strive to be my ancestors\u2019 wildest dreams and to influence the next generation of Black engineers.\u201d        Also in the Samueli School of Engineering, Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering Timothy Downing is leading a team of interdisciplinary researchers working to uncover the molecular and physical principles of epigenome replication. The project is funded through a $3 million NSF grant for research that seeks to better understand the dynamic nature of the epigenome, which will open new possibilities for cellular engineering. The award will also support activities that broaden participation in science among high schoolers and undergraduates, including students from underrepresented groups. In addition, Downing received $2 million in funding for a 2019 New Innovator Award. With this work, he aims to shed light on how mechanical cues integrate with and give rise to disease-driving epigenetic mutations, ultimately leading to the discovery of better treatment options for cancer patients.    \u201cBlack History Month is a great opportunity for us all to reflect and remember to bring our full self into the edges of the social networks that we live and work in,\u201d says Downing. \u201cIt represents the idea that there\u2019s space in our society for everyone to exist and participate authentically. When we do that, incredible things happen.\u201d        In the School of ICS, Assistant Professor of Informatics Roderic Crooks studies the intersections of race, technology and public life. His current project explores how community organizers in working-class communities of color use data for activist projects, even as they dispute the proliferation of data-intensive technologies in education, law enforcement, financial services and other vital sites of civic concern.    \u201cThe pursuit of science, including information and computer sciences, does not exempt anyone from participation in the complex dynamics and shared histories of anti-Black racism in the United States and across the world,\u201d says Crooks. \u201cWe are all deeply enmeshed in systems of power and privilege that benefit some and harm others based on interlocking hierarchies of citizenship, wealth, race, class, gender, sexuality and disability. I am encouraged by the increased willingness of our students to name these dynamics and to consider the study of structural oppression central to the work we do in ICS.\u201d        Also in the School of ICS is Ian Harris, who has been a professor in the Department of Computer Science since 2004. His research interests include the design of secure hardware and software systems and the application of natural language understanding to security and design. His current projects include the detection of phone-based social engineering attacks, the formalization of natural language specifications, and the development of a cyber test range to evaluate the security of IoT systems. He is also leading a team of students participating in the MITRE Embedded Capture the Flag competition.        Joni Ricks-Oddie is the first full-time director of the UCI Center for Statistical Consulting and is also director of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS) Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design (BERD) Unit. By managing both, Ricks-Oddie \u2014 who earned her Ph.D. in epidemiology from UCLA in 2012 \u2014 has streamlined processes so the two groups operate in sync as a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for the UCI community and affiliated organizations needing to collaborate with a statistician. She works with a variety of organizations, including Chapman University and Children\u2019s Hospital of Orange County, and has organized many training sessions and workshops at UCI. She has a heart for working on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)-related projects and is currently helping to lead the ICTS Black Thriving Initiative Strategic Plan as well as working with faculty in the Statistics department to expose underrepresented minority (URM) middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science.    \u201cEvery few decades our nation has a crisis of conscience as it pertains to its Black citizenry,\u201d says Ricks-Oddie. \u201cWe change policies, enact new laws, develop diversity initiatives and commit to do better. Unfortunately, each time, the situation or crisis that initiated the movement ultimately gets forgotten and society moves on to some other, more fashionable issue. I truly hope this time we do not get weary in well-doing and are able to sustain our commitment to making UCI a place where Black people are truly able to thrive and be their authentic selves.\u201d    \u2014 Shani Murray","keywords":"","name":"Black History Month: Sharing Resources to Expand Diversity in Tech","thumbnailUrl":"","wordCount":"2089","timeRequired":"PT9M17S","mainEntity":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https:\/\/www.cs.uci.edu\/black-history-month-sharing-resources-to-expand-diversity-in-tech\/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"coby","description":"","url":"https:\/\/www.cs.uci.edu\/author\/coby\/","sameAs":[],"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/56e9f2ffdafef7be63b54ab4571d9fe4?s=96&d=mm&r=g","height":96,"width":96}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Department of Computer Science \u2013 Donald Bren School of Information &amp; Computer Sciences","url":"https:\/\/www.cs.uci.edu"},"image":[{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/www.ics.uci.edu\/bin\/img\/news\/BlackHistoryMonth2022-TayloriaAdams.jpg","width":1200,"height":675,"@id":"https:\/\/www.cs.uci.edu\/black-history-month-sharing-resources-to-expand-diversity-in-tech\/#primaryimage"},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/www.ics.uci.edu\/bin\/img\/news\/BlackHistoryMonth2022-TimothyDowning.jpg","width":300,"height":300},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/www.ics.uci.edu\/bin\/img\/news\/BlackHistoryMonth2022-Crooks.jpg","width":400,"height":400},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/www.ics.uci.edu\/bin\/img\/news\/BlackHistoryMonth2022-Harris.jpg","width":250,"height":250},{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/www.ics.uci.edu\/bin\/img\/news\/BlackHistoryMonth2022-JoniRicksOddie.jpg","width":400,"height":400}]}]

<p>Last year, in honor of Black History Month, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/">ICS</a>) highlighted pioneers in science and technology (see <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/view_news?id=1920">Part I</a> and <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/view_news?id=1928">Part II</a> of the post). This year, we’ve pulled together a list of resources, including on-campus groups here at UCI. We also list some nationwide organizations and books that focus on diversity and race in technology, as well as spotlight some Black leaders in computer science and engineering, both on and off campus.</p>



<span id="more-3669"></span>



<p>“When we think about Black History Month, we usually begin by acknowledging those who have come before us and who are often overlooked in our society,” says Gregory Diggs-Yang, assistant director of the Stacey Nicholas Office of Access and Inclusion (<a href="https://oai.tech.uci.edu/">OAI</a>). “We should always honor those trailblazers, but we should also recognize those great contributors who are currently widening the trail and those who are just beginning down it.”</p>



<p>Created in 2014, OAI is a joint office between ICS and the <a href="https://engineering.uci.edu/">Henry Samueli School of Engineering</a>, focused on recruiting, retaining and graduating talented students from historically excluded populations. “The following is not meant to be an exhaustive list,” stresses Diggs-Yang, “but rather a starting point for reflection during Black History Month and a way to recognize current Black visionaries and new pioneers. I am excited to be acknowledging the current unsung heroes of Black history as it is being made.”</p>



<p><strong>Creating a Supportive Campus Culture</strong><br>We start with a list of organizations at UCI that are focused on supporting the Black community:</p>



<ul><li>The <strong>Black Faculty &amp; Staff Association</strong> (<a href="https://sites.uci.edu/bfsa/">BFSA</a>) provides a sense of purpose for African American faculty and staff by creating a presence on campus that is visible, supportive, nurturing and productive in serving the needs of the African American community (sign up for the <a href="https://maillists.uci.edu/mailman/listinfo/bfsa-list">BFSA list serve</a>).</li><li>The <strong>Black Graduate Student Network</strong> (<a href="https://sites.uci.edu/bgsn/">BGSN</a>) provides an encouraging, inclusive, social networking community for African American graduate and professional students at UCI. The organization’s goals are to strengthen camaraderie among African American students, celebrate the culture they proudly represent, and voice their life and educational experiences to younger underrepresented students so that they may be inspired and supported to pursue graduate education.</li><li>The <strong>Center for Black Cultures, Resources &amp; Research</strong> (<a href="https://blackcultures.uci.edu/">CBCRR</a>) provides a just, safe, vibrant, inclusive, culturally supportive and socio-ecologically sustainable space — a home away from home — where Black students can thrive and reach for their highest potential.</li><li>The <strong>East African Student Association</strong> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucieasa">EASA</a>) is a cultural organization dedicated to building a community among the East African student population and sharing meaningful experiences and conversations.</li><li>The <strong>National Society of Black Engineers</strong> (<a href="http://uci-nsbe.weebly.com/">NSBE</a>) is a student organization that helps improve the recruitment and retention of Black engineering students.</li><li>The <strong>Nigerian Student Association</strong> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/nsa.uci">NSA</a>) is a cultural organization that aims to bring together students and staff from the African diaspora who are interested in learning more about the roots and beauty of Nigeria.</li></ul>

<p>These are in addition to UCI’s <a href="https://inclusion.uci.edu/uci-black-thriving-initiative/">Black Thriving Initiative</a>, developed specifically to recognize and respond to “anti-Blackness as an existential threat to our mission as public research university.” The initiative is working to create a university culture where Black people thrive.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/news/BlackHistoryMonth2022-TayloriaAdams.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"/></figure></div>



<p>In the Samueli School of Engineering, Assistant Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tayloriaadamsphd/"><strong>Tayloria Adams</strong></a> studies the physical properties of stem cell and cancer cell populations using innovative microfluidic devices. Her projects use electric currents and cell motion to develop membrane capacitance and other measurable cellular properties as reliable label-free biological markers. She holds a patent for her discoveries and was a National Science Foundation (NSF) Postdoctoral Fellow and UCI Chancellor’s ADVANCE Postdoctoral Fellow. Adams recently earned a prestigious NSF CAREER award and an award from the University of California Cancer Research Coordinating Committee. Also, she is working with a multidisciplinary team to develop a curriculum focused on the meaningful engagement of minoritized students in the classroom. This NSF-funded grant, led by Pheather R. Harris, director of UCI’s California Alliance for Minority Participation, is cutting-edge and explores the environmental factors causing minoritized students to leave STEM. Adams is also highly engaged in activities to increase the number of Black high school, undergraduate and graduate students pursuing STEM fields.</p>



<p>“Black History Month is very important to me,” says Adams. “It’s a chance for reflection on the strength of my ancestors, which I channel into my research, teaching, and service. I strive to be my ancestors’ wildest dreams and to influence the next generation of Black engineers.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/news/BlackHistoryMonth2022-TimothyDowning.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"/></figure></div>



<p>Also in the Samueli School of Engineering, Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-downing-903ab43b/"><strong>Timothy Downing</strong></a> is leading a team of interdisciplinary researchers working to uncover the molecular and physical principles of epigenome replication. The <a href="https://engineering.uci.edu/news/2020/7/nsf-awards-uci-led-team-3-million-epigenetics-research">project</a> is funded through a $3 million NSF grant for research that seeks to better understand the dynamic nature of the epigenome, which will open new possibilities for cellular engineering. The award will also support activities that broaden participation in science among high schoolers and undergraduates, including students from underrepresented groups. In addition, Downing <a href="https://engineering.uci.edu/news/2019/10/two-uci-engineers-named-nih-new-innovators">received</a> $2 million in funding for a 2019 New Innovator Award. With this work, he aims to shed light on how mechanical cues integrate with and give rise to disease-driving epigenetic mutations, ultimately leading to the discovery of better treatment options for cancer patients.</p>



<p>“Black History Month is a great opportunity for us all to reflect and remember to bring our full self into the edges of the social networks that we live and work in,” says Downing. “It represents the idea that there’s space in our society for everyone to exist and participate authentically. When we do that, incredible things happen.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/news/BlackHistoryMonth2022-Crooks.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"/></figure></div>



<p>In the School of ICS, Assistant Professor of Informatics <a href="https://www.rncrooks.info/"><strong>Roderic Crooks</strong></a> studies the intersections of race, technology and public life. His current project explores how community organizers in working-class communities of color use data for activist projects, even as they dispute the proliferation of data-intensive technologies in education, law enforcement, financial services and other vital sites of civic concern.</p>



<p>“The pursuit of science, including information and computer sciences, does not exempt anyone from participation in the complex dynamics and shared histories of anti-Black racism in the United States and across the world,” says Crooks. “We are all deeply enmeshed in systems of power and privilege that benefit some and harm others based on interlocking hierarchies of citizenship, wealth, race, class, gender, sexuality and disability. I am encouraged by the increased willingness of our students to name these dynamics and to consider the study of structural oppression central to the work we do in ICS.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/news/BlackHistoryMonth2022-Harris.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"/></figure></div>



<p>Also in the School of ICS is <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~harris/"><strong>Ian Harris</strong></a>, who has been a professor in the Department of Computer Science since 2004. His research interests include the design of secure hardware and software systems and the application of natural language understanding to security and design. His current projects include the detection of phone-based social engineering attacks, the formalization of natural language specifications, and the development of a cyber test range to evaluate the security of IoT systems. He is also <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/view_news?id=2092">leading a team</a> of students participating in the MITRE Embedded Capture the Flag competition.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/news/BlackHistoryMonth2022-JoniRicksOddie.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"/></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonilricks/"><strong>Joni Ricks-Oddie</strong></a> is the first full-time director of the <a href="https://statconsulting.uci.edu/">UCI Center for Statistical Consulting</a> and is also director of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS) Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design (<a href="https://www.icts.uci.edu/services/berd1.php">BERD</a>) Unit. By managing both, Ricks-Oddie — who earned her Ph.D. in epidemiology from UCLA in 2012 — has streamlined processes so the two groups operate in sync as a “one-stop shop” for the UCI community and affiliated organizations needing to collaborate with a statistician. She works with a variety of organizations, including Chapman University and Children’s Hospital of Orange County, and has organized many training sessions and workshops at UCI. She has a heart for working on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)-related projects and is currently helping to lead the ICTS Black Thriving Initiative Strategic Plan as well as working with faculty in the Statistics department to expose underrepresented minority (URM) middle and high school students to careers in statistics and data science.</p>



<p>“Every few decades our nation has a crisis of conscience as it pertains to its Black citizenry,” says Ricks-Oddie. “We change policies, enact new laws, develop diversity initiatives and commit to do better. Unfortunately, each time, the situation or crisis that initiated the movement ultimately gets forgotten and society moves on to some other, more fashionable issue. I truly hope this time we do not get weary in well-doing and are able to sustain our commitment to making UCI a place where Black people are truly able to thrive and be their authentic selves.”</p>
