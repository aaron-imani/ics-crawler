		I am a Lecturer (Teaching) in the Department of Statistical Science at University College London and I am currently on leave from my Assistant Professor of Teaching (tenure-track) position in the Department of Statistics at University of California Irvine. I am an educator with an interest in statistics and data science education and I am an applied statistician with experience in educational research. In short, my educational work is in statistics and data science and my statistics and data science work is in education (Pre K - graduate school). 

      My goal is to create educational resources for statistics and data science that are accessible physically and cognitively. My work focuses on modern pedagogical
      approaches in the statistics curriculum, making data science education accessible, and undergraduate
      Bayesian education. I am the coauthor of the book Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Applied Bayesian Modeling. 
I am the lead PI on the NSF-funded project  Advancing Bayesian Thinking in STEM, a co-PI on the NSF-funded SoCal Data Science project, and one of the PIs on the NIH funded project Irvine Summer Institute in Biostatistics and Undergraduate Data Science. I teach a variety of statistics, computing, and data science classes at the undergraduate and graduate levels. I write blog posts about data, pedagogy, and data pedagogy at  DataPedagogy.com. I co-chair the (American) national Undergraduate Statistics Project Competition
      and Electronic Undergraduate Statistics Research Conference
      (USPROC/eUSR).
