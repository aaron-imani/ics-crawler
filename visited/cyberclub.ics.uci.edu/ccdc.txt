CCDC
Where Cybersecurity Gets Real
  


Cyber’s team at the 2020 Western Regional Collegiate Cybersecurity Competition (WRCCDC) qualifier.

What is it?
Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition is where you take the skills you learn to the next level:
defending a small business network in real time from trained cybersecurity experts. A true test
of grit and knowledge, CCDC has a reputation of being highly demanding, yet also highly rewarding.
What does joining look like?
Joining CCDC means joining a team of highly motivated individuals who meet every week to
learn about new defense techniques, common security mistakes, and proper setup and configuration.
I’m new!
While sometimes overwhelming, CCDC is a great place to jump in for beginners as well, since
the team structure is meant to facilitate cooperative learning and many CCDC veterans are
happy to help explain
What’s Next?
