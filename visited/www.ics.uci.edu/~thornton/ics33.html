      <p>Welcome!  Please note a few things as we get started this quarter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This course is being offered in an <i>in-person</i> format, which is to say that your physical presence on campus will be required at various points throughout, and we will not be offering a separate virtual experience to students who are not physically attending.</li>
        <li>You may find that each course you're enrolled in this quarter runs quite differently from the others, so I encourage you to read through this course web site for details on how this course will be run.  Notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>, and the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a>, as well as sets of <a href="Notes">Notes and Examples</a> and <a href="Exercises">Reinforcement Exercises</a> that will be posted throughout the quarter.</li>
        <li>Additional to this web site, you will find that there is a Canvas course space, as well as an Ed Discussion discussion board.  More details about how we'll be using each of these spaces is available in the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.</li>
