    				Yearly tests    			


Many friends have been asking me about my health.  Here is an update.
I had CT Scan and PET Scan to check for any traces of Cancer about two weeks ago.
I was informed by Dr. Bill Miller that results came out excellent.  There are no signs of any abnormalilty or
cancer.  And I have not been on any medication for the last 16 months.
Now I am hoping to get back  stamina and my old knees so I could start playing Tennis one of these days. (Oops, Sudha has threatened me that the day I start Tennis, she is going to leave me.  Maybe I should not wait to get back the stamina.  🙂  )
