A Panel on:
At Home with UCI Health

Abstract:We are organizing a webinar where our Vice Chancellor of IT and Data, Tom Andriola, and CIO of UCI Health, Scott Joslyn, are going to present UCI Health’s current activities for digital health and their “The Continuous Care Vision for UCI Health”.  In addition to the primary objective of this innovation which is to provide care for UCI patients, it also represents a tremendous amount of data being collected, which is then planned to be made available back to the research community through “The Collaboratory for Health and Wellness.”  This is a closed seminar for IFH members with the plan to solicit inputs from UCI faculty working in this area. Our guests will be covering digital strategies at UCI Health for 1) Virtual Visits, 2) Mobile ED/Urgent Care, 3) Remote Patient Monitoring, 4) Acute Hospital at Home, 5) Advanced Analytics & AI, and how it connects back to The Collaboratory.

About Lecturer:We are cordially inviting all the IFH members to participate in this webinar + open discussion. This is a unique and timely opportunity for all of our members to provide feedback and impact the future of UCI Health. The idea is to have a two-way discussion (rather than a one-way info session) to identify how UCI Health and UCI as a whole can support faculty in their research and how UCI faculty can contribute to these activities.
