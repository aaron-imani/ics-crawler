Alexa Together, a subscription-based service, by Amazon
December 14, 2021
Alexa Together, a subscription-based service, has been launched by Amazon to offer remote health and wellbeing support to the elderly. The service uses Amazon’s range of Echo devices with new features such as fall detection and 24/7 emergency assistance 1.
Family members and caregivers can select to receive alerts through the app when the end-user (i.e., the elderly) uses the device for the first time each day. The device will also contact caregivers along with emergency services if needed. In addition, the service provides fall detection integrated with third-party devices from Assistive Technology Service and Vayyar Care. The device will contact emergency services and caregivers if the person falls within the range of the device. Alexa Together also allows remote assist features, by which family members can set reminders, create a shopping list, read the news aloud, etc.
Currently, the service is only available in the U.S, and only one family member can link their device to receive notifications through Alexa Together. However, Amazon announced that it would provide remote support for up to 10 people.
Moreover, Amazon has been using Alexa-enabled devices in hospitals and senior living facilities since this year. The end-users can get access to entertainment while communicating with the care team members if needed.
