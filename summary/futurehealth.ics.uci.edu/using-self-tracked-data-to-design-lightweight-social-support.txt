Using self-tracked data to design lightweight social support
People often struggle to receive the support they desire from friends and families around their health behavior goals. We are examining how lightweight social media platforms where people share mundane, daily updates like Snapchat and story features on Instagram and Facebook can provide opportunities for such support as people struggle to incorporate healthy eating choices or physical activity into their routines. Following on preliminary surveys on understanding how to present tracked health and wellness data on these platforms, we are building and deploying an app to allow people to share this data on their own social media.
