ZotCare


In ZotCare platform we want to provide the researchers with a platform to design a human study or for
the health providers to  design study trial for their participants or patients.
So in ZotCare platform we provide all the necessary services that you need for such a study, for example the questionnaires, data
collection, creating profile, creating events and triage and also some  automatic recommendation based on what you need.
Services include but are not limited to some questionnaire services to provide some dynamic questionnairesi conditions. These questionnaires can also be interventions so you can have pictures, you can have for example like
different steps inside these questionnaires there are some data collection services for direct data collection for example
