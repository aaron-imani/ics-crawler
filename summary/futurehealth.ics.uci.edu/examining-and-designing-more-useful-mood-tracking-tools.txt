Examining and designing more useful mood tracking tools
People are widely adopting apps for tracking their moods and emotions. We aim to understand how and why these apps are being used and whether they are providing the benefit people desire. Early findings suggest a mismatch between how often people tend to open mood tracking apps (about once a day) and what mood tracking apps support journaling (mood in the moment). We are beginning to examine how these findings may support the design of an effective once-a-day mood tracking app.
