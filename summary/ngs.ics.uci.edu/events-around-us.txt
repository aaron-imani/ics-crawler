    				Events around us    			


I am returning back tonight.  The last few days have been very exciting on many fronts â€“ particularly seeing the EventWeb evolving and now taking shape to make it really useful.
It is clear that events play important role in many aspects of computer science.  But Seraja is developing its service to bring events of interest to consumers.  Commonly when people talk about events, they think about the calendar of events.  Calendars capture events of interest and importance, but that is only one type.  Many events are not planned â€“ they just happen.  Most News is concerned with such events.  All aspects of unscheduled events may become of great interest and may give rise to many more unscheduled events.  Last weekâ€™s blasts in Mumbai are a good example of that.  This event has shaken up the whole country and has been the main topic of attention in printed as well as TV News.  While considering events, one can not ignore such events.
Another very important aspect is that events in isolation are of value, but their value increases exponentially if one could create a web of events.  The networking effect is more powerful in events than in pages of documents.  The WWW is the result of creating explicit links to lead to the Web of pages.  These links were explicit links.  Lately many techniques are being explored to find and use implicit links among pages. Utilization of such implicit links will increase further the power and utility of the Web.
For events such implicit links will be significantly more powerful and useful.  My head starts spinning when I consider possibilities of using the EventWeb  After some consideration, I decided to write a series of posts on events, EventWeb, and the implications of all these to us.  Will start this series soon.
