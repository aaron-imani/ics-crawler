Developing estimation techniques for determining health states
Current Healthcare systems are focused on diseases, not health.  We adopt and build on the perspective that a body is characterized by its health state.  Disease is just a name give to an undesirable health state.  This perspective is essential for chronic diseases where health state is slowly building up to the emergency situation.  If we can track health state using inexpensive, maybe low precision but continuous sensors then we can understand deteriorating health state much before the emergency situation.  Moreover, one can aspire to have a better health state as a goal to improve their quality of life.  Health state is then use to provide correct lifestyle and medication (if needed) guidance to people to guide in achieving their health goals.
We are actively working on developing estimation techniques for determining health states.
